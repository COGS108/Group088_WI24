    "The interplay between alcohol consumption and academic performance is an area of significant concern for stakeholders across the educational landscape, including students, faculty, staff, and parents. At institutions like Kansas State University (K-State), the observed negative associations between alcohol use and academic outcomes—such as missing classes, lagging behind in coursework, underperforming on exams or papers, and overall lower grades—underscore the urgency of addressing this issue.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) K-State's Academic Achievement Center and Lafene Health Center offer myriad services to support students struggling with academic challenges related to substance abuse and mental health, highlighting institutional efforts to combat the adverse effects of alcohol on student success.\n",

    "Further, the broader research community, as evidenced by findings shared through sources like orcd-library.org, acknowledges the multifaceted impact of alcohol consumption on educational outcomes.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Alcohol's influence extends through biological, behavioral, and emotional pathways, affecting cognitive functions, school attendance, and students' engagement with their academic work. Notably, heavy episodic drinking, prevalent among adolescents, correlates with a range of negative health and educational outcomes. The research underscores not only the direct effects of alcohol on neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment but also the broader behavioral and emotional ramifications that can detract from a student's academic commitment and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This complex relationship is further complicated by the bidirectional nature of alcohol use and academic outcomes, where poor performance may drive increased alcohol consumption as a coping mechanism. Confounding factors such as family income, parental education, self-esteem, and motivation also play critical roles in shaping this dynamic. The dataset from the survey of students in math and Portuguese language courses at the secondary school level, encompassing a wide array of variables including alcohol consumption (Dalc and Walc), study habits (studytime), and academic performance (G1, G2, and G3 grades), presents an invaluable resource for delving into these interactions. By examining the specific impacts of alcohol consumption within this rich dataset, this study aims to contribute nuanced insights into the strategies and interventions that can support student success in the face of these challenges.\n",

    "**Hypothesis:** Higher levels of alcohol consumption among secondary school students (measured by Dalc for weekdays and Walc for weekends) are anticipated to be negatively correlated with their academic performance, particularly in math and Portuguese language courses, as reflected in their grades (G1, G2, and G3). This hypothesis is predicated on the premise that alcohol consumption impairs cognitive functions and academic engagement, leading to lower academic achievements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** This hypothesis is rooted in the broader literature, which has documented the adverse effects of alcohol on cognitive capabilities, memory formation, and educational engagement. Given that alcohol consumption can disrupt sleep patterns, affect concentration, and lead to increased absenteeism, it logically follows that students engaging in higher levels of alcohol consumption would exhibit poorer academic performance. By analyzing the relationship between alcohol consumption rates and academic outcomes, we aim to clarify how these behaviors impact student success, controlling for potential confounding factors to ensure a robust examination of this relationship."

The quality of family relationships (`famrel`) will help us understand the familial context of these students, potentially highlighting how alcohol impacts or is impacted by family dynamics. Additionally, assessing students' free time and social activities (`freetime`, `goout`) will provide insights into the role of peer influence. Finally, study habits (`studytime`) will offer a lens through which to view the balance between academic pursuits and extracurricular influences, including alcohol consumption.

    "**Ethics & Privacy Issues:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research into the relationship between alcohol consumption and academic performance in secondary students raises several ethical and privacy concerns, primarily related to the sensitivity of the data involved and the potential for bias in our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Sensitivity and Privacy:** The dataset contains sensitive information regarding students' alcohol consumption habits, academic performance, and personal demographics. There is a potential risk of identifying individual students, especially in smaller subsets of data. To mitigate this risk, we will ensure all data used is anonymized, with no direct or indirect identifiers present in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bias in Data Collection:** Our dataset might not equally represent all student populations, potentially excluding or under-representing certain groups based on geography, socio-economic status, or other factors. This could introduce biases that skew our analysis and conclusions. To address this concern, we will critically assess the dataset's composition and collection methods, seeking to understand and acknowledge any limitations in our analysis. Where possible, we will use statistical techniques to adjust for known biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Detecting and Handling Biases:** To detect biases in our dataset, we will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify any disproportionate representation of groups. During analysis, we will be mindful of how these biases could influence our findings and will use statistical methods to minimize their impact. After analysis, we will transparently communicate any biases or limitations identified in our study, ensuring that our findings are interpreted within the appropriate context.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Equitable Analysis and Impact:** There is a risk that our analysis could inadvertently stigmatize students who consume alcohol or those from specific demographics. To prevent this, we will approach our analysis with sensitivity, focusing on the broader systemic factors that contribute to our findings rather than attributing behaviors or outcomes to individual moral failings. We will also consider the potential impact of our findings on policy and practice, advocating for interventions that are supportive and non-punitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handling Identified Issues:** Any issues related to data privacy or bias identified during our research will be addressed through modifications to our analysis plan and by applying appropriate statistical adjustments. We commit to conducting our research ethically, prioritizing the privacy and dignity of the students represented in the dataset, and being transparent about our methodology and findings. Also, if we find any issues above our handle, we will report them to the course staff and seek guidance on how to proceed."

Then, include your group’s expectations of one another for successful completion of your COGS108 project below. Discuss and agree on what all of your expectations are. Discuss how your team will communicate throughout the quarter and consider how you will communicate respectfully should conflicts arise. By including each member’s name above and by adding their name to the submission, you are indicating that you have read the COGS108 Team Policies, accept your team’s expectations below, and have every intention to fulfill them. These expectations are for your team’s use and benefit — they won’t be graded for their details.\n",
