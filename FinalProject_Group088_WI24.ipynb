    "The interplay between alcohol consumption and academic performance is an area of significant concern for stakeholders across the educational landscape, including students, faculty, staff, and parents. At institutions like Kansas State University (K-State), the observed negative associations between alcohol use and academic outcomes—such as missing classes, lagging behind in coursework, underperforming on exams or papers, and overall lower grades—underscore the urgency of addressing this issue.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) K-State's Academic Achievement Center and Lafene Health Center offer myriad services to support students struggling with academic challenges related to substance abuse and mental health, highlighting institutional efforts to combat the adverse effects of alcohol on student success.\n",

    "Further, the broader research community, as evidenced by findings shared through sources like orcd-library.org, acknowledges the multifaceted impact of alcohol consumption on educational outcomes.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Alcohol's influence extends through biological, behavioral, and emotional pathways, affecting cognitive functions, school attendance, and students' engagement with their academic work. Notably, heavy episodic drinking, prevalent among adolescents, correlates with a range of negative health and educational outcomes. The research underscores not only the direct effects of alcohol on neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment but also the broader behavioral and emotional ramifications that can detract from a student's academic commitment and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This complex relationship is further complicated by the bidirectional nature of alcohol use and academic outcomes, where poor performance may drive increased alcohol consumption as a coping mechanism. Confounding factors such as family income, parental education, self-esteem, and motivation also play critical roles in shaping this dynamic. The dataset from the survey of students in math and Portuguese language courses at the secondary school level, encompassing a wide array of variables including alcohol consumption (Dalc and Walc), study habits (studytime), and academic performance (G1, G2, and G3 grades), presents an invaluable resource for delving into these interactions. By examining the specific impacts of alcohol consumption within this rich dataset, this study aims to contribute nuanced insights into the strategies and interventions that can support student success in the face of these challenges.\n",

    "**Hypothesis:** Higher levels of alcohol consumption among secondary school students (measured by Dalc for weekdays and Walc for weekends) are anticipated to be negatively correlated with their academic performance, particularly in math and Portuguese language courses, as reflected in their grades (G1, G2, and G3). This hypothesis is predicated on the premise that alcohol consumption impairs cognitive functions and academic engagement, leading to lower academic achievements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** This hypothesis is rooted in the broader literature, which has documented the adverse effects of alcohol on cognitive capabilities, memory formation, and educational engagement. Given that alcohol consumption can disrupt sleep patterns, affect concentration, and lead to increased absenteeism, it logically follows that students engaging in higher levels of alcohol consumption would exhibit poorer academic performance. By analyzing the relationship between alcohol consumption rates and academic outcomes, we aim to clarify how these behaviors impact student success, controlling for potential confounding factors to ensure a robust examination of this relationship."

    "**Description**: The dataset sourced from a survey of students in aged 15-22, provides a detailed examination of alcohol consumption patterns and their implications on mental health and academic performance, devoid of a specific focus on Math or Portuguese courses. It encompasses a variety of data types, including academic metrics, parental background, and lifestyle choices, to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing adolescent development. Last updated 7 years ago, as well as created by a research group at the University of California, Irvine, the dataset is a valuable resource for understanding the complex interplay between alcohol consumption and academic performance. The preparation for analysis will include meticulous cleaning, preprocessing, and the creation of new features to accurately reflect the intricate relationships at play. This process aims to unravel the complex dynamics between early alcohol exposure and its effects on adolescents' academic achievements and social interactions, providing insights into the broader ramifications on their support networks.\n",

The visualizations will help us understand the distribution of the features and identify any potential patterns or associations that could inform our analysis. Through a series of visualizations, we aim to uncover underlying patterns and distributions within the data. By using bar charts and histograms, we can visually represent and contrast the frequency and distribution of both categorical and numerical variables. This visualization approach not only facilitates a more intuitive understanding of the data but also aids in identifying any anomalies or trends that may warrant further investigation. Our goal is to utilize these insights to inform potential areas of research focus, such as the impact of study habits on academic success or the correlation between health factors and student attendance."
